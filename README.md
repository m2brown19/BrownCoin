BrownCoin is a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency that I created. 

It is not for sale because it is too valuable!! 

IMPORTANT NOTE: This project's requirements specifically required it use one source code file. Thus, instead of separating out my Java classes into multiple files, I had to combine them into one.
